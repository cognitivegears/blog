## Introduction

The TRS-80 (later rebranded Tandy) Color Computer 2 was my first computer and the system that I first learned to program on. Unfortunately, the one that I had when I was young is long since gone. First we upgraded to a CoCo 3 (I don't actually know what happend to the CoCo 2, but it was probably sold when my parents bought the CoCo 3) and then later to a number of other systems, finally landing on IBM PC compatibles. But when I was young we were to be found in our living room, tying up the TV with the CoCo 2 hooked to it, more often than not typing in a game from a magazine and trying to get it to run.

Because of this, the Tandy Color Computer series has always been my favorite 8-bit computer system, and probably the system that I am most nostalgic for. I have a couple of CoCo 3 systems today, but until now didn't have a CoCo 2. Now I've managed to get my hands on one, but it seems like it's been through a lot. Let's see what we can do to get it fixed up.

## Restoring a Tandy Color Computer

I got this TRS-80 Color Computer 2 from [Shop Goodwill](shopgoodwill.com). I didn't get a particularly good deal on it, but it was exactly what I was look for as far as a system, an original 16K CoCo2. They didn't have a picture of the model number, but based on the case badge I was hopeful. It came untested, and the pictures showed how dirty the system was. I decided to take a chance on it anyway.
